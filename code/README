## Converting genotypes to VCF format

The following scripts were run on the PPS cluster at UChicago.

Starting with the Plink file, the file dox-hg38.vcf was created with the script
genotypes.py. This file does not contain phasing information.

Starting with the genotype files from Complete Genomics, the per-chromosome
genotypes, e.g. dox-hg38-chr9.vcf.gz, were created with the scripts
convert-cgi-to-vcf.py and convert-cgi-to-vcf.sh. These files are phased using
the parent of origin information.

The scripts convert-cgi-to-vcf-test.R and convert-cgi-to-vcf-test.sh perform
some sanity checks on the genotype files.
