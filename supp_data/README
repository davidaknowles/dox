This directory contains the Supplementary Material for our study "Determining the genetic basis of anthracycline-cardiotoxicity by molecular response QTL mapping in induced cardiomyocytes", including larger files not in the official Supplement. These are: 
- log2_counts_per_million.txt.gz: gene expression quantification for 217 samples with >10M exonic reads in our dataset. 
- sample_table.txt: the rows of this table correspond to the columns of log2_counts_per_million.txt.gz
- leafcutter_counts.txt.gz: LeafCutter alternative splicing quantification on all samples. 
- leafcutter_samples.txt: the rows of this table correspond to the columns of leafcutter_counts.txt.gz
- all_eqtl.txt.gz: all tested SNP-gene pairs using total expression model (suez) only. p_geno is the p-value for a marginal effect eQTL, p_interact for a response-eQTL. 
- all_eqtl_w_ase.txt.gz: all tested SNP-gene pairs using allele specific expression as well as total expression. p_geno is the p-value for a marginal effect eQTL, p_interact for a response-eQTL. 
- all_splicing_qtl.txt.gz all tested SNP-intron pairs. Columns are analogous to all_eqtl.txt.gz. 
- rarg_trans_eqtl.txt.gz: trans eQTL for the rs2229774 non-synonymous variant in RARG. p_geno: marginal effect eQTL p-value. p_interact: response eQTL p-value. Columns starting "q_" correspond to Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-values.  
- embryoid_staing.pdf: iPSC quality control. This represents a superset of the lines differentiated into cardiomyocytes. 
- purity.txt: FACS measurements of cardiomyocyte purity, columns are: 
	* cell_line - the cell line number. Each cell line corresponds one individual.
	* dbgap - anonymized ID for matching cell_line to genotypes.
	* flow_date - date of flow cytometry experiment
	* purity - percentage of cells that expressed cardiac troponin (cTnI and cTnT)
- annotation.txt has meta data associated with each sample, and columns:
	*  **id** - unique ID for sample. Composed of sample number, cell line, and dosage information.
	*  **sample** - sample number. Range from 1-230. Each set of 5 are the treatments for one individual, in increasing concentrations of dox.
	*  **cell_line** - the cell line number. Each cell line corresponds one individual.
	*  **dbgap** - anonymized ID for matching cell_line to genotypes.
	* **sample_id** - anonymized ID assigned to each unique combination of `dbgap` and `dosage.
	*  **dosage** - the concentration of dox used in the treatment.
	*  **rin** - the RNA Integrity Number (RIN). Range from 1-10.
	*  **rna_conc** - the RNA concentration (ng/uL) after RNA extraction.
	*  **lib_prep_batch** - the batches the libraries were prepared in.
	*  **index** - the TruSeq adapter index used for multiplexing.
	*  **library_conc** - the concentration (ng/uL) of the library measured on the Bioanalyzer.
	*  **fragment_size** - the mean fragment size as measured on the Bioanalyzer.
	*  **qpcr** - the library concentration (nmol) as measured via qPCR.
	*  **qpcr_dilute** - the concentration (nmol) of the diluted library.
	*  **master_mix** - the master mix for pooling libraries. 10 samples (2 individuals) per master mix.
	*  **lane_perc** - The percentage of sequences in one lane that were assigned to a sample.
