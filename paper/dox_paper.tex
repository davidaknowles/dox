\section*{Introduction}

Anthracyclines, including the prototypical doxorubicin, continue to be used as chemotherapeutic agents treating a wide range of cancers, particularly leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, breast cancer, and sarcoma. 
A well-known side-effect of doxorubicin treatment is anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity (ACT). 
For some patients ACT manifests as an asymptomatic reduction in cardiac function, as measured by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), but in more extreme cases ACT can lead to congestive heart failure (CHF). 
The risk of CHF is dosage-dependent: the earliest study estimated 3\% of patients at 400 mg/m2, 7\% of patients at 550 mg/m2, and 18\% of patients at 700 mg/m2 develop CHF\cite{Swain2003}, where a more recent study puts these numbers at 5\%, 26\% and 48\% respectively. 
ACT prevalence rates in pediatric patients are notably higher \cite{todo}
Perhaps most daunting for patients is that CHF can occur years after treatment. 
Reduced LVEF shows a similar dosage-dependent pattern, but is not fully predictive of CHF. 

Various candidate gene studies have attempted to find genetic determinants of ACT, but are plagued by small sample sizes and unclear endpoint definitions, resulting in limited replication between studies. 
Two ACT genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been published. 
While neither found genome-wide significant associations using their discovery cohorts, both found one variant that they were able to replicate in independent cohorts. 

A nonsynonymous coding variant, rs2229774, in RARG (retinoic acid receptor $\gamma$) was associated with pediatric ACT using a Canadian European discovery cohort of 280 patients\cite{Aminkeng2015}, and replicated in both a European ($p=0.004$) and non-European cohort ($p=1 \times 10^{-4}$). 
RARG negative cell lines have reduced retinoic acid response element (RAREs) activity and reduced suppression of \emph{Top2b}\cite{Aminkeng2015}, which has been proposed as a mediator of ACT. 

% 794 + 51
A GWAS in 845 patients with European-ancestry from a large adjuvant breast cancer clinical trial, 51 of whom developed CHF, found no variants at genome-wide significance levels\cite{Schneider2016} , but rs28714259 ($p=9 \times 10^{-6}$ in discovery cohort) replicated in two further cohorts ($p=0.04, 0.018$). 
rs28714259 falls in a glucocorticoid receptor protein binding peak, which may play a role in cardiac development. 

An exciting approach to studying human disease is to use induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cells as model systems for disease. Work by us and others has demonstrated that iPSCs and derived cell-types are powerful model systems for understanding cell-type specific genetic regulation of transcription \citep{Thomas2015,Burrows2016,Banovich2017,hipsci}, but it remains to be shown whether these systems can be used to model specific disease settings. Encouragingly, the response of iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (ICs) to doxorubicin was recently extensively characterized\cite{Burridge2016}. ICs derived from four individuals who developed ACT after doxorubicin treatment (``DOXTOX'' group) and four who did not (``DOX'' group), showed clear differences in viability (via apoptosis), metabolism, DNA damage, oxidative stress and mitochondrial function when exposed to doxorubicin, suggesting that ICs recapitulate \emph{in vivo} differences between individuals. Gene expression response differences between the DOX and DOXTOX groups were demonstrated using RNA-sequencing, but the sample size was insufficient (3 DOX vs. 3 DOXTOX) to attempt mapping of genetic variants that might explain the observed functional differences between lines. 

Here we use a panel of iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes derived from 45 individuals, exposed to four different drug concentrations, to map the genetic basis of doxorubicin-sensitivity. We find hundreds of genetics variants that modulate the  transcriptomic response, including 46 that act on alternative splicing. We show that the transcriptomic response is predictive of cardiac troponin response in these cell-lines and that the mapped variants show significant enrichment in lower ACT GWAS $p$-values.

\subsection*{Cardiomyocyte differentiation}

We successfully generated iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes for 45 Hutterite individuals (Figure 1a). We confirmed cardiomyocyte identity using 

TODO: ? 

\subsection*{Measuring transcriptomic response to doxorubicin exposure}

We exposed all 45 cardiomyocyte lines to doxorubicin at 4 different concentrations for 24 hours, after which cells were processed for RNA-sequencing. We obtained sufficient read depth (10M exonic reads) for downstream analysis for 217 of the $5 \times 45 = 225$ individual-concentration pairs, and confirmed sample identity by calling exonic SNPs. We observed a strong response to doxorubicin across all concentrations, with 98\% (12038 / 12317) of quantifiable genes (5\% FDR) showing differential expression across concentrations. Our data shows excellent concordance with an existing smaller RNA-seq dataset\cite{Burridge2016} (Supplementary Figure \ref{fig:burridge}). Principal component analysis (PCA, Figure 1b) confirms that the main variation in the data is driven by doxorubicin concentration and that the effect of concentration on expression is nonlinear. For some individuals the $1.25\mu M$ sample is closer to $0.625 \mu M$, whereas for others it is closer to $2.5\mu M$, suggesting there is systematic variation in how different individuals respond to doxorubicin exposure. Since the majority of genes appear responsive to doxorubicin we clustered genes into six distinct response patterns using a mixture model approach (Figure 1c, see Methods). From largest to smallest, these clusters represent genes that are 1) down regulated 2) initial up, then further down-regulated 3) up-regulated 4) transiently down regulated 5) transiently up-regulated 6) down-regulated then partially recover. Gene set enrichments (Supplementary Figure~\ref{fig:go}) for the up-regulated cluster include metabolic, mitochrondrial and extracellular processes, as well as known doxorubicin response genes in breast cancer cell lines \cite{graessmann2007chemotherapy}. The down-regulated cluster shares genes with those down-regulated in response to UV light, which, like doxorubicin, causes DNA-damage. Targets of p53, a transcription factor that responds to DNA damage, are overrepresented in clusters 2 and 5; these clusters involve up-regulation at low concentrations ($0.625\mu M$) but down-regulation at higher concentrations.

\subsection*{Mapping variants modulating doxorubicin response}

The false positive rate (FPR) is estimated using a parametric bootstrap. \textbf{c.} We developed a statistical method to assign the major and minor allele response to one of the six clusters from Figure 1c. The strongest 46\% of detected reQTL result in a discretely different response, whereas the remainder only modulate the response. \textbf{d.} We calculated relative genotype effect sizes by dividing the fitted effect size at each concentration by the (signed) effect size with the largest absolute value. $K$-means clustering of these effect size profiles reveals distinct patterns, the most common being a small reduction in absolute effect size from $0$ to $0.625\mu M$ and then the largest effect being at high concentrations. \textbf{e.} An example response-eQTL where rs112594884 regulates the response of the mitochondrial complex I chaperone NDUFAF1. Under the major (T) allele we see moderate down-regulation at $0.625\mu M$ followed by up-regulation at higher concentrations. Under the minor (G) allele, we see little change at $0.625\mu M$ followed by substantial down-regulation. Since the genotype effects are reduced at $0.625\mu M$ and largest at high concentrations this reQTL is assigned to cluster 1 of panel \textbf{d}.}}
    \label{fig2}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

We next sought to map single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that modulate the observed transcriptomic response to doxorubicin, leveraging genetic variation across the 45 individuals. We use a linear mixed model approach which allows us to account for relatedness amongst the individuals, intra-individual variation and latent confounding (by extending the PANAMA framework\citep{Fusi2012}). Testing SNPs within 1Mb of the transcription start site (TSS), 518 genes have a variant with a detectable marginal effect on expression (5\% FDR). Reassuring, these eQTL replicate in GTEx heart tissue, and do so more strongly than in GTEx brain or lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) data (Figure 2a). Remarkably, even with our moderate number of individuals, we are able to detect many response-eQTL (reQTL), i.e. variants that modulate transcriptomic response to doxorubicin. At a nominal 5\% FDR  we find reQTL for 376 genes, which we estimate using a parametric bootstrap corresponds to a true FDR of $8.5\%$ (Figure 2b). 

To characterize the detected reQTL we assigned the response of the major and minor allele to one of the six clusters previously learned (Figure 1c), with heterozygotes expected to display the average of the two homozygous responses. 172 (46\%) of reQTL result in a qualitatively distinct response as determined by the two alleles being assigned to different clusters. The most common transition, occurring for 33 reQTL, is that the major allele is associated with simple down-regulation (cluster 1) in response to doxorubicin, whereas the minor allele shows a transient up-regulation at low concentration followed by down-regulation at higher concentration (cluster 2). 

We further broke-down the significant reQTL by considering the effect of genotype on expression at each concentration ($\beta_c$ in Equation~\ref{eq:betac}). We normalized relative to the $\beta_c$ with the largest absolute value, i.e. we consider $\beta_c / \beta_{\arg \max{ |\beta_{c'}| }} $, so that the largest genotype effect always corresponds to a normalized value of 1. We clustered the resulting normalized effect profiles into 9 clusters (Figure 2d). The largest cluster (cluster 1, 85 reQTLs) represents reQTL with a modest effect size at low concentrations ($0,0.625\mu M$) which is amplified at higher concentrations (Figure 2e shows a highly significant example). Cluster 2 corresponds to reQTL whose effect size is attenuated at $0.625\mu M$: examples in this cluster tend to have higher expression that $0.625\mu M$ and what could be buffering of very high expression levels which reduces the genetic effect (e.g. rs16853200's association with ABCA12 response, Supplementary Figure \ref{fig:ABCA12}).

\subsection*{Alternative splicing} 

% Splicing and ox stress:

We queried the extent to which doxorubicin exposure disrupts splicing patterns using \texttt{LeafCutter}\cite{leafcutter}. Across all samples \texttt{LeafCutter} detected 27769 alternative splicing ``clusters'' (referred to here as ``ASC'' to avoid confusion with $k$-means clusters) , which correspond approximately to unique splicing events, with a median of 3.0 splice junctions per ASC. 10430 (59\%) ASCs, corresponding to 6398 unique genes, showed an effect of doxorubicin exposure on splicing outcomes (5\% FDR). To understand these changes we calculated the entropy of the splicing choices made for each significant ASC and used $k$-means clusters patterns of change in entropy (Figure \ref{fig_splicing}a). The largest cluster has 6166 ASCs (59\%), and corresponds to the null of no clear change in entropy across concentrations. Clusters 2 ($n=1136$) and 5 ($n=475$) correspond to increasing entropy with concentration, and clusters 3, 4, 6, 8 and 9 correspond to the maximum entropy being at different concentrations and reaching different maximum levels. Interestingly, only the relatively small clusters 8 ($n=304, 3\%$) corresponds to a reduction in entropy with increasingly concentration, suggesting the dominant pattern involves reduced splicing fidelity and increased alternative splicing in response to doxorubicin. 

We further tested the hypothesis that splicing fidelity decreases in the presence of doxorubicin by comparing patterns of $\Psi$ change with canonical vs cryptic (unannotated) splice site usage. We clustered the 7792 introns in significantly differentially spliced ASC, that have $\Delta \Psi > 0.1$ for some pair of concentrations, into 8 response patterns based on their relative excision proportions across concentrations. For each cluster we calculated the proportion of member introns with either neither end annotated, one end unannotated, or both ends annotated (Figure \ref{fig_splicing}b). The clusters representing increased $\Psi$ with concentration (clusters 2, 4, 6 and 7) all show enrichment for cryptic splice site usage. The two most populous clusters (1 and 2) correspond to $\Psi$ decreasing and increasingly continuously with doxorubicin concentration, respectively, and the difference in levels of cryptic splicing is extremely apparent (hypergeometric $p < 2 \times 10^{-16}$, odds ratio for one annotated end vs two is $28.0$).

TODO say something about this agreeing with known findings for individual genes.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{../figures/fig3_splicing.pdf}     \caption{\it{Doxorubicin exposure significantly impacts alternative splicing. \textbf{a} The entropy of splicing choices increases in response to doxorubicin exposure. We measured splicing entropy at different concentrations within \texttt{LeafCutter} ``Alternative Splicing Clusters'' (ACSs) and clustered these into patterns of entropy change. \textbf{b} We separated introns differentially excised with $\Delta \Psi > 0.1$ into 8 clusters based on their relatively excision level at each concentration. Introns in clusters corresponding to increased excision at higher doxorubicin concentrations (e.g. cluster 2) are far more likely to use a cryptic (unannotated) splice site at at least one end. $p$-values shown are for a hypergeometric test of that cluster against all others. \textbf{c} We mapped 42 ASCs with response splicing QTL, variants that modulate the differential splicing response to doxorubicin.}}
    \label{fig_splicing}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

We additionally used \texttt{LeafCutter} quantification of percentage spliced in (PSI) for each splice junction to map splicing QTL (sQTL) and response-splicing QTL (rsQTL) using the same methodology as we employed for reQTL mapping. We tested SNPs within 100kb of either end of the splice junction. At 5\% FDR we found 467 ASCs with marginal effect sQTL and 42 with rsQTL. An example is rs72922482's association with inclusion of exon 2 of APAF1 Interacting Protein (APIP). Under the major T allele exon skipping is extremely rare: the \texttt{LeafCutter} PSI for the spanning junction ranges from $0.00059$ to $0.0049$ across concentrations (Figure \ref{fig_splicing}c). In rs72922482 heterozygotes however the exon is skipped in a significant proportion of transcripts, and this effect is most pronounced at $1.25 \mu M$, with approximately 50\% exon inclusion, suggesting the minor C allele results in very low inclusion of the cassette exon. Another interesting example is NDUFAF6, another mitochrondrial Complex I protein, where doxorubicin exposure (particularly at $0.625 \mu M$) results in increased use of an alternative downstream transcription start site (TSS) which unmasks the influence of rs896853 on a cassette exon between the two alternative TSS (Supplementary Figure \ref{fig:NDUFAF6}).

\subsection*{Troponin response}

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{../figures/fig4_troponin.pdf}     \caption{\it{Transcriptomic response is predictive of doxorubicin induced damage as measured by cardiac troponin. \textbf{a.} We measured cardiac troponin, a sensitive and specific test for myocardial damage, in response to doxorubicin, across all cell lines. \textbf{b.} We summarized gene expression response by first fitting a ``principal curve'' following increasing doxorubicin concentration, and then measuring the rate of progression along this curve for each individual. \textbf{c.} Increased transcriptomic response is associated with reduced cardiac troponin response, suggesting that the bulk of expression changes we observe are in fact protective against cardiac damage.}}
    \label{fig_troponin}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

We cardiac troponin to measure damage occurring as a result of doxorubicin exposure, using the same concentrations as for our expression profiling. We observed significant variation in measurable damage caused by doxorubicin across individuals, with 13 out of 45 cell lines having a significant (positive) response (Figure 4a). We first sought to determine whether the inter-individual variation in troponin response could be explained by variation in expression response. Since we are interested in inter-individual rather than between concentration differences we normalized the troponin response to have 0 mean and variance of 1 across samples at each doxorubicin concentration. We found 96.1\% (95\% credible interval $[91.5\% 98.6\%]$) or 92.1\% percentage of the variance in this normalized troponin response could be explained using gene expression levels at the corresponding doxorubicin concentrations, using a GCTA-style analysis\cite{gcta} or leave-out-one cross validated LASSO\cite{lasso} respectively. The optimal LASSO model included 118 genes, listed in Supplementary Table S1. 



To compare troponin sensitivity to transcriptomic response we aimed to determine an overall per-individual measurement of transcriptomic response with respect to doxorubicin concentration. To this end we fit a principal curve\citep{princurve} through all gene expression samples, initializing the curve to pass sequentially through the successive doxorubicin concentrations (Figure 4b). This methodology allowed us to project every sample on the principal curve to give a single measure of ``progression'' through doxorubicin response. We then regressed these values against concentration for each individual to obtain a progression rate value. We found the troponin response slope is significantly negatively correlated (Spearman $\rho=-0.42, p=0.004$, Figure \ref{fig_troponin}c) with the transcriptomic response rate, suggesting that much of the gene expression program being activated in response to doxorubicin is in fact protective against cardiac damage. 


\subsection*{GWAS enrichment} 

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{../figures/fig5_gwas.pdf}     \caption{\it{Cardiomyocyte molecular QTL are enriched in ACT GWAS. \textbf{a.} SNPs that have either a marginal or response eQTL with $p<10^{-5}$ are enriched in GWAS variants with $p<0.05$ (hypergeometric test $p=3 \times 10^{-6}$). \textbf{b.} rs4058287 has a GWAS $p$-value of $9.68\times 10^{-6}$ and is a nominally significant eQTL ($p=0.0016$) for ALPK2, which is down-regulated in response to doxorubicin. \textbf{c.} }}
    \label{fig:gwas}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

% Statistical signal for the eQTL and GWAS co-localizes for ADCY2 at rs6893414.

We were interested in whether our eQTL could be used to interpret the ACT GWAS of Schneider et al. \cite{Schneider2016}. While this GWAS was not sufficiently powered to find genome-wide significant associations, 11 variants representing 9 independent loci have $p<10^{-5}$, with the most significant (rs2184559) at $p=2.8 \times 10^{-6}$. Of the 8 GWAS variants with $p<10^{-5}$ either tested in our eQTL mapping, or in high LD ($R^2 > 0.8$) with a tested SNP, 7 have nominally significant marginal eQTL ($p<0.05$, the 8th has $p=0.07$) and four have reQTL with $p<0.1$. rs4058287 (GWAS $p$-value $9.68\times 10^{-6}$) has a marginal effect on Alpha-Protein Kinase 2 (ALPK2, also known as ``Heart Alpha-Protein Kinase'' since it was discovered in mouse heart\cite{ryazanov1999alpha} and is expressed in few other tissues\cite{gtex}) expression ($p=0.0016$) as well as a weak interaction effect ($p=0.06$, see Figure \ref{fig:gwas}a). Interestingly, ALPK2 has been shown to upregulate DNA repair genes and to enable caspase-3 cleavage and apoptosis in a colorectal cancer model\citep{yoshida2012alpk2}. 

We additionally assessed whether there was detectable enrichment of low GWAS $p$-values for our molecular QTLs. For total gene expression we considered SNPs with either a marginal or response eQTL with nominal $p < 10^{-5}$ (corresponding approximately to 5\% FDR) and found a significant enrichment for GWAS $p$-values under $0.05$ (one-sided hypergeometric $p=3 \times 10^{-6}$, OR=$1.2$, Figure \ref{fig:gwas}b). We observed a more modest enrichment for splicing QTL: using the same criteria to define a set of sQTL variants we observe significant enrichment in GWAS $p$-values under $0.005$ (one-sided hypergeometric $p=0.02$, \ref{fig:gwas}c) but not under $0.05$ (one-sided hypergeometric $p=0.7$).  

\section*{Discussion}

\section*{Methods} 

\subsection*{Sample collection and genotyping}

\subsection*{iPSC reprogramming and cardiomyocyte differentiation} 

\subsection*{Doxorubicin exposure}

\subsection*{RNA-sequencing}

\begin{itemize}
\item 50bp single end on HiSeq 4000 [two rounds]
\item QC using fastqc and multi\_qc. 
\item Confirmed sample identity using exonic SNPs. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Expression quantification}

We aligned RNA-seq reads using STAR version 2.5.2a to GRCh38/GENCODE release 24. We counted reads using featureCounts and calculated counts per million reads (cpm) using `cpm` from the `edgeR` R package (version 3.18.1). We discarded samples with $<10^9$ reads and genes with median $\log_2(cpm)$ less than $0$. 

\subsection*{Differential expression analysis} 

We performed differential expression (DE) analysis across all 5 doxorubicin concentrations jointly, using either a linear model on quantile normalized cpm value or Spearman correlation, followed by Benjamini-Hochberg False Discovery Rate (FDR) control. Since the vast majority of genes showed differential expression we did not investigate better powered DE methods such as DESeq2. 

We clustered genes into ``response patterns'' using a $K$-component mixture model 
\begin{align}
\pi &\sim \text{Dir}(1/K,\cdots,1/K) \nonumber \\ 
z_g | \pi &\sim \text{Discrete}(\pi) \nonumber \\
y_{ngc} | z_g, \theta &\sim N( \theta_{cz_g}, \sigma^2 )
\label{eq:mixture}
\end{align}
where $\pi$ is a prior probability vector over cluster assignments, Dir is the Dirichlet distribution, $z_g$ is cluster from which gene $g$ is generated, $y_{ngc}$ is the expression of gene $g$ in individual $n$ at concentration $c$, $\theta_{ck}$ is the mixture parameter (mean) across concentrations for cluster $k$, and $\sigma^2$ is a shared noise variance. 
We marginalize (sum) over $z_g$ and optimize with respect to $\pi, \theta, \sigma$ using the RStan R package (version 2.16.2). 
The hyperparameters of the Dirichlet distribution are set such that in the limit of large $K$ the model approximates a Dirichlet process mixture \cite{maceachern1998estimating} which allows learning of an appropriate number of mixture components to use from data. 

\subsection*{Response eQTL mapping} 

We extended the PANAMA\cite{Fusi2012} linear mixed model (LMM) framework to map eQTLs and response eQTLs while accounting for latent confounding. PANAMA entails a two step procedure. Step one is used to learn latent factors from all genes, using the model
\begin{align*}
y_{ncg} &= \sum_k W_{kg} x_{nck} + u_{ng} + v_{cg} + \xi_{ncg} + \epsilon_{ncg} \\
W_{kg} & \sim N(0, \sigma^2_k ) \qquad \textit{ factor loadings/coefficients } \\ 
u_{ng} &\sim N(0, \sigma^2_u) \qquad \textit{ individual random effects } \\
\xi &\sim MVN(0, \sigma^2_\xi \Sigma ) \qquad \textit{ kinship random effect }  \\
\epsilon &\sim MVN(0, \text{diag}(\sigma^2_\epsilon)) \qquad \textit{ noise } 
\end{align*}
where $x_{nck}$ are latent factors, $v_{cg}$ are per gene, per concentration fixed effects. We integrate over $W, u, \xi$ and $\epsilon$, which results in a per gene multivariate normal,
\begin{align}
y_{:g} \sim MVN\left( V v_{:g} , \sum_k \sigma^2_k x_{:k} x_{k:}^T + \sigma^2_u U + \sigma^2_\xi \Sigma + \sigma^2_e I \right),
\end{align}
where $y_{:g}$ refers to the vector of expression for gene $g$ across all individuals and concentrations (i.e. all ``samples'' where a sample is an individual-concentration pair), $V$ is a matrix mapping concentrations to samples (i.e. $V_{sc}=1$ iff sample $s$ is at concentration $c$) and $U$ is a matrix of which samples are for the same individual (i.e. $U_{ss'}=1$ if sample $s$ and sample $s'$ come from the same individual). We optimize $x,v$ and the variances $\{ \sigma^2_u, \sigma^2_k,  \sigma^2_\xi, \sigma^2_\epsilon \}$ jointly across all genes $g$. 

In step 2 we test individual gene-SNP pairs while accounting for confounding using the covariance matrix 
\begin{align}
 \Sigma_\pi = \sum_k \sigma^2_k x_{:k} x_{k:}^T + \sigma^2_u U + \sigma^2_\xi \Sigma 
 \end{align}
which includes both latent confounding, individual random effects and similarity due to kinship. We consider three LMMs, all with the same parameterization of the covariance $\sigma^2_\pi \Sigma_\pi + \sigma^2_e I$ where $\sigma^2_\pi$ and $\sigma^2_e$ are optimized along with the fixed effects to allow the extent to which each gene follows the global covariance pattern to be adapted. The simple structure of this covariance also allows pre-computation of the eigen-decomposition of $\Sigma_\pi$ which enables linear (rather than cubic) time evaluation of the likelihood and its gradient. 

Model 0 involves no effect of the SNP (and can therefore be fit once for a gene), a fixed effect for concentration. Model 1 adds a marginal effect of the SNP genotype dosage $d$. Finally model 2 adds an interaction effect between concentration and genotype, which is equivalent to a concentration-specific genotype effect. In summary: 
\begin{align}
\text{Model 0: }& \mathbb{E}[ y_{ncg} ] = v_{cg} \\ 
\text{Model 1: }& \mathbb{E}[ y_{ncg} ] = v_{cg} + \beta d_n \\
\text{Model 2: }& \mathbb{E}[ y_{ncg} ] = v_{cg} + \beta_c d_n \label{eq:betac}
\end{align}
We optimize $\sigma^2_\pi$, $\sigma^2_e$ and the regression coefficients for each of the three models separately, and use likelihood ratio tests (LRT) to compare the models. Comparing Model 1 vs 0 (one degree of freedom) tests whether there is a marginal effect of the variant. Comparing Model 2 vs 1 ($C-1=4$ degrees of freedom, where $C$ is the number of conditions/concentrations) tests whether there is an interaction effect, i.e. whether the genetic effect on expression is different at different concentrations (or equivalently whether the response to doxorubicin is different for different genotypes). Finally Model 2 vs 0 ($C=5$ degrees of freedom) tests whether there is any effect of genotype on expression, either in terms of a marginal or concentration-specific effect. We use the conservative approach of using Bonferroni correction across SNPs for a gene, followed by Benjamini-Hochberg FDR control. 

We quantile normalize the expression levels across all samples for each gene to a standard normal distribution so that the distributional assumptions of our linear mixed model are reasonable. However, optimizing the variance parameters $\sigma^2_\pi$ and $\sigma^2_e$ means that the $\chi^2$ distribution for the LRT will only hold asymptotically and $p$-values for finite sample sizes will tend to be somewhat anti-conservative. To account for this for response-eQTL we use a parametric bootstrap since there is no fully valid permutation strategy for testing interaction effects. This involves first fitting Model 1 and then simulating new expression data under the fitted model. Models 1 and 2 are then (re)fit to this data and compared using an LRT. We then perform Bonferroni correction across SNPs for each gene to obtain an empirical null distribution of per gene $p$-values which we use to estimate the true FDR for our response-eQTL results. 

For significant reQTL we assigned the response of the minor allele and major allele to the previously determined clusters using the model
\begin{align*}
y_{nc} | z_A,z_a, \theta &\sim N\left( \frac12 d_n \theta_{cz_A} + \frac12 (2 - d_n) \theta_{cz_a}, \sigma^2 \right),
\end{align*}
where $y_{nc}$ is the expression for individual $n$ at concentration $c$, $z_A$ and $z_a$ are the cluster assignments for the major and minor allele respectively, $d_n \in \{0,1,2\}$ is the genotype dosage, and $\theta$ and $\sigma^2$ are fixed at the values learned in Equation \ref{eq:mixture}. For each reQTL separately we calculate the likelihood of $y$ given all possible pairs of assignments $(z_A,z_a)$ and choose the maximum likelihood solution.

Higher concentrations are not shown since including these compresses the first PC obscuring the relevant variation.}}
